# House Price Prediction with Regression
The market historical data set of real estate valuation are collected from Sindian Dist., New Taipei
City, Taiwan.
The goal of this project is to predict the house price of unit area in Taiwan (10000 New Taiwan Dollar/Ping, where Ping is a local unit, 1 Ping = 3.3 meter squared).

Prediction is done by regression method which work with technique for investigating the relationship 
between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome.

In this project, used some Python library, such as:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- pylab
- scipy
- sklearn

Used four different models to do regression, there are:
- Linear regression
- Ridge regression
- Random Forest
- SVR (Support Vector Regression)

To find which the best model, need to evaluate models with comparison of these score:
- R-Square
- MSE (Mean Square Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
